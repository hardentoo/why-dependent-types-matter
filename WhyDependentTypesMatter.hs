-- This module contains Haskell implementation of code presented in --
-- "Why Dependent Types Matter" paper by Thorsten Altenkirch, Conor --
-- McBride and James McKinna. Original code in the paper was        --
-- written in Epigram but with its official web page offline        --
-- Epigram seems to be dead. I initially rewrote that code in Agda, --
-- then in Idris and now in Haskell.  Original paper elides details --
-- of some proofs. I supplied the missing parts so that the code in --
-- this module is complete and self-contained.  I assume however    --
-- that you are familiar with "Why Dependent Types Matter" paper    --
-- and thus I don't comment most of the functions.                  --

-- Note that this code is intended to demonstrate how to do         --
-- dependently-typed programming in Haskell.  It reinvents some     --
-- functions and data types present in base package shipped with    --
-- GHC 7.8.  In real life you most likely want to use library       --
-- functions instead of writing everything from scratch.  All data  --

sym :: (a :~: b) -> (b :~: a)
sym Refl = Refl

-- b) congruence: if a equals b, then (f a) equals (f b).  For the sake of

-- abstract singletons using a data family (see singletons library).

-- c) substitution: if we have a proposition that is true for a and a equals b,

-- of two types `a` and `b` then subst performs a type-safe cast from type

--

--
-- in the paper. Call to vrevacc2 produces Vec with index n :+ (Succ m). The
-- problem is we need index Succ (n :+ m) as a result.  We have to prove their
-- equality.  We already proved with plusSucc that Succ (n + m) equals n + (Succ
-- m). Since now we're proving something opposite we make use of symmetry: we
-- apply sym to plusSucc. Having a proof is not enough - we must apply it to
-- convert from the result produced by vrevacc2 to the result expected by the
-- typechecker. To do this we use subst function.
